## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Components
- **PMC_PATIENTS** - 167K+ medical case studies from PMC literature
- **HEALTHCARE_DEMO** - Analysis tables, AI processing procedures, and demo scenarios

### Application Components  
- **Streamlit Application** - Multi-page web interface for healthcare professionals
- **AI Processing Engine** - Batch and real-time analysis using Snowflake Cortex AI
- **Connection Helper** - Works in both local development and Snowflake environments

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Snowflake Account** with:
   - Cortex AI features enabled
   - ACCOUNTADMIN or sufficient privileges for database creation
   - Compute warehouse access

2. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.11+ (required for Snowflake stored procedures)
   - pip package manager

3. **Development Setup**:
   - Git repository access
   - Text editor or IDE

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfc-gh-sweingartner/MedicalTranscriptsSPCS.git
   cd MedicalTranscriptsSPCS
   ```

2. **Get the PMC Patient Data**:
   The PMC-Patients.csv file (584MB, 167K+ medical cases) is not included in this Git repository.
   
   Contact **stephen.weingartner@snowflake.com** to request the dataset. You can either:
   - Receive the CSV file to place at: `Data/PMC-Patients.csv`
   - Request a direct Snowflake data share (preferred)

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Using pip with pyproject.toml (recommended)
   pip install -e .
   
   # Or using uv (faster, modern Python package installer)
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Configure Snowflake Connection**:
   Create `~/.snowflake/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   default_connection_name = "healthcare_demo"

   [connections.healthcare_demo]
   account = "your-account-identifier"
   user = "your-username"
   password = "your-password"
   role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"  # or role with database creation privileges
   warehouse = "your-warehouse"
   ```

5. **Run Complete Deployment**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/deploy_healthcare_demo.py
   ```

   This automated script will:
   - ✅ Create PMC_PATIENTS database and load patient data
   - ✅ Create HEALTHCARE_DEMO database with all analysis tables
   - ✅ Install batch processing procedures with AI integration
   - ✅ Set up demo scenarios and reference data
   - ✅ Configure Cortex Search for fast patient retrieval
   - ✅ Validate the complete installation

5. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/streamlit_main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to run the setup manually:

1. **Setup PMC_PATIENTS Database**:
   ```bash
   snowsql -f sql/00_setup_pmc_patients_database.sql
   # Then upload CSV: PUT file:///path/to/Data/PMC-Patients.csv @PMC_DATA_STAGE;
   # And load data using the COPY INTO commands in the SQL file
   ```

2. **Setup HEALTHCARE_DEMO Database**:
   ```bash
   snowsql -f sql/01_create_database_objects.sql
   snowsql -f sql/02_create_subset_and_new_tables.sql
   snowsql -f sql/03_create_batch_processing_procedure.sql
   ```

3. **Launch Streamlit**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/streamlit_main.py
   ```
